## Resolutions

I was a bit skeptical on whether to create a 2021 resolutions list, as it was already a very difficult year last time, and it might not be a very good idea to challenge oneself further. But while reflecting on last years resolutions, I decided to go for that again, but with a more simple and limited list this time. Honestly, I had high expectations in 2020, which can be found [here with reflections](/newyearresolutions2020/), and this year has nothing to do with it. 

In general, I'll try to maintain both physical and pyschological health, and keep what I've been doing (research, reading papers, advising, teaching...). Here are the items I'll aim for in 2021: 

- Submit a top conference research paper
- Get the German driver's licence
- Speak German whenever possible
- Do sports weekly

These are relatively modest compared to last year, but are the most important things to help me keep what I need doing, and I know will be challenging for me. So that's it folks! Stay healthy!

## Reflections

End of the year, taking a look at what I wrote 12 months ago, suggesting a "more simple and limited list compared to 2019", I realize that even these were not very simple for this year. Pandemic not being over, having the vaccine shots, trying to keep up the health was just enough effort. Overall, to sum up the items listed:

- Submit a top conference paper -> Done, actually submitted 2! 
- Get the German driver's licence -> Half done, practical exam is waiting for me. It was more difficult than expected.
- Speak German whenever possible -> Done, I have spoke a lot of German!
- Do sports weekly -> Done (ehm), not weekly but it was frequent enough given all other deadlines and responsibilities

I am content with the year. I say 3.5/4 was accomplished. Now the question is whether to make a new post for next year or continue with this one. It is a bit funny because I haven't posted anything this year except the resolutions list. I guess I have been putting all my writing efforts into papers. Anyways, I will go try writing a German post this time. Cheers
