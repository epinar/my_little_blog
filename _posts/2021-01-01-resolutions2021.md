I was a bit skeptical on whether to create a 2021 resolutions list, as it was already a very difficult year last time, and it might not be a very good idea to challenge oneself further. But while reflecting on last years resolutions, I decided to go for that again, but with a more simple and limited list this time. Honestly, I had high expectations in 2020, which can be found [here with reflections](/newyearresolutions2020/), and this year has nothing to do with it. 

In general, I'll try to maintain both physical and pyschological health, and keep what I've been doing (research, reading papers, advising, teaching...). Here are the items I'll aim for in 2021: 

- Submit a top conference research paper
- Get the German driver's licence
- Speak German whenever possible
- Do sports weekly

These are relatively modest compared to last year, but are the most important things to help me keep what I need doing, and I know will be challenging for me. So that's it folks! Stay healthy!
