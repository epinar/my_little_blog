I was a bit skeptical on whether to create a 2021 resolutions list, as it was already a very difficult year last time, and it might not be a very good idea to challenge oneself. But while reflecting on last years resolutions, I decided to go for that again, but with a more simple and limited list this time. 

In general, I'll try to maintain both physical and pyschological health, and keep what I've been doing (research, reading papers, advising, teaching...). Here are the 5 items I'll aim for in 2021: 

- Submit a top conference paper
- Get the German driver's licence
- Speak German whenever possible
- Do sports weekly

These are relatively modest compared to last year, but are the most important things that I need to keep doing, and I know will be challenging for me. So that's it folks! Stay healthy!
