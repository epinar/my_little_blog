While reading Judea Pearl's [book of "why"](http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/WHY/), I digged a bit more into the statistical paradoxes and decided to sum the most interesting ones here. They work as brain-teasers and eye-openers, and it would be helpful to integrate them into our daily critical thinking and decision-making processes.

## Monty Hall Problem

Let's assume that you're on a game, and there are three doors upon you where one leads to a car and the others lead to goats. You pick the door #1, and the host opens one of the goat-doors. Now, you can either stay on your door, or switch your door. What would you do?

You should switch your door, if the host did not choose the door at random. Here is why:

| Door 1 | Door 2 | Door3  | Switch  | Stay
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------- | ------
| Car    | Goat   | Goat   |  Lose   |  Win
| Goat   | Car    | Goat   |  Win    |  Lose
| Goat   | Goat   | Car    |  Win    |  Lose

So, if you switch the door, the possibility of win is 2/3. 
This is not really intuitive before seeing this table.

However, if the host would choose a random door (no matter it is goat or car), then staying would lead us to a higher chance of winning.
