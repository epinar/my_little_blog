As a tradition, I make a new year's resolutions list every year and keep track of what I have accomplished that past year. This time, I have decided to share them here as I have my personal blogsite now. I will be keeping updates. Here is a nice photo from Munich Marienplatz during Christmas celebrations :)

Normally, I create different sections in my resolutions list, such as physical health, psychological health, career, education, musical, and so on... Here, I will share the non-private ones. 

**Education**
- Graduate from Master's degree [Q1]
- Apply to PhD positions (ideally until getting an acceptance)! [Q1]
- Learn more on reinforcement learning, distributed ML and discover niche topics
- Write paper-reviews on the new topics you have learned
- CS concepts recap after masters graduation (undergrad & masters: algorithms, operating systems, databases, programming languages, architecture, ml, cv, nlp, signal processing)

**Career**
- Submit paper to a top conference (ECCV, Neurips, AAAI, IROS, ACL, EMNLP)
- Publish paper in a conference (top conference, low conference, workshops)
- Participate in a Kaggle contest (ideally with Nazif or Suzan)
- Solve a LeetCode hard problem every Sunday [Q1 check]
- Become fully financially independent (job, phd, full scholarship) [Q1]

**Music**

- Play these pieces in cello:
	- Saint Saens Allegro Appasionato 
	- Brahms E Minor Cello sonata

	- Chromatics, 7ths, double stops

**Books**
- Read 24 books [Q1 check] 
- 12 fiction, 12 non-fiction
- At least 18 of them in English

**Language**
- Lerne weiter Deutsch. Die Sprache wird immer besser <3 (B1->B2) [Q1 check]
- No te olvides del español. Habrá un viaje a América del Sur en el futuro. (Duolingo, peliculas) [Q1 check]
- Keep learning русский alphabet for the транс сибирский trip. [Q1 check]

There are 20 items in the list! In the end of the year, I will see how many of them are accomplished and analyse them one by one :) Some of them might have a major role in my life path. Yet, I believe all of them are more or less equally important to keep my overall mental&psychological health and happiness in balance. Also, the grade should have some easy points as well as the harder ones, right? 

**A note on why I do that:** According to some psychological research, it is shown that putting countable goals increases the possibility of reaching to these goals (eg. using a fitbit to increase number of daily steps). Some suggest that sharing the goals publicy increase chances of success. And finally some also suggest that putting high goals is especially highly correlated with reachability.

I come from a country where the individual development is usually not seen as a positive aspect, and hard-working people are mostly recognized as asocial and weird types. In my opinion, a major reason behind that might be the corrupted government and hopeless individuals who believe that success is not based on hard-work but purely on connections. But, as I have been living in other countries for last 2.5 years, I have seen that hard working can actually be rewarded. Hence, to hard worker, I put slightly higher expectations in my 2020 resolution. Sharing this list publicly is also counted towards increasing the expectation, and it helps to increase the chances of success :)

 **Update on April 4th for first quarter**

 So far, it has been going interesting. I will add a "[Q1]" next to the items I accomplished. 
 I have been in stay-home quarantine since last month, reading a lot, playing music, doing Duolingo daily, I'm done with my Master's and will continue with doctoral studies. I have submitted a past project to a conference workshop. It was not accepted in the proceedings, but accepted only as a poster in non-proceedings track. I was kinda expecting that, and I will not work on that further as I don't have financial support for that project(also workshop attendance is expensive). But still it was nice to have some feedbacks and review other papers.
