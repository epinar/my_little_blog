As a tradition, I make a new year resolutions list for every year and keep track of what I have accomplished that past year. This year, I have decided to share them here as I have my personal blogsite now. I will be keeping updates during the year. Here is a nice photo from Munich Marienplatz Christmas celebrations :)

Normally, I create different sections in my resolution list, such as physical health, psychological health, relationships, career, education, musical, and so on... Here, I will share the non-private ones :) 

**Education**
- Graduate from Master's degree
- Apply to PhD positions (ideally until getting an acceptance)!
- Learn more on Reinforcement Learning and distributed ML (coursera)
- Write paper-reviews on the new topics you have learned
- CS concepts recap after masters graduation (undergrad & masters: algorithms, operating systems, databases, programming languages, architecture, ml, cv, nlp, signal processing)

**Career**
- Submit paper to a top conference (ECCV, Neurips, AAAI, IROS, ACL, EMNLP)
- Publish paper in a conference (top conference, low conference, workshops, or even journal)
- Participate in a Kaggle contest (ideally with Nazif or Suzan)
- Solve a LeetCode hard problem every Sunday
- Become fully financially independent (job, phd, scholarship)!

**Musical**
- Finish up 100 days of cello challenge on Instagram
- Play these pieces in cello:
	- Saint Saens Allegro Appasionato 
	- Brahms E Minor Cello sonata
- Cello scales:
	- ABRSM lvl 8
	- Chromatics, 7ths, double stops
- Theory
	- Keep learning harmony

	- Coursera: "Developing Your Musicianship"

**Books**
- Read 24 books
- 12 fiction, 12 non-fiction
- At least 18 of them in English

**Language**
- Lerne weiter Deutsch. Die Sprache wird immer besser <3 (B1->B2)
- No te olvides del español. Habrá un viaje a América del Sur en el futuro. (Duolingo, peliculas)
- Keep learning русский alphabet for the транс сибирский trip.

There are 20 items in the list + the private ones! In the end of the year, I will see how many of them are accomplished and analyse them one by one :) Some of them might have a major role in my life path. Yet, I believe all of them are more or less equally important to keep my overall mental&psychological health and happiness in balance. Also, the grade should have some easy points as well as the harder ones, right? 

**A note on why I do that:** According to some psychological research, it is shown that putting countable goals increases the possibility of reaching to these goals (eg. using a fitbit to increase number of daily steps). Some suggest that sharing the goals publicy increase chances of success. And finally some also suggest that putting high goals is especially highly correlated with reachability.

I come from a lazy country, where the individual development is not seen as a positive aspect, and hard-working people are recognized as asocial and weird types. A major reason behind that is the corrupted government and hopeless individuals who believe that success is not based on hard-work but purely on connections. But, as I have been living in Europe for last 2.5 years, I have seen that hard working is really rewarded here, and, as I expect, in all first world countries. Hence, to hard worker, I put slightly higher expectations in my 2020 resolution. Sharing this list publicly is also counted towards increasing the expectation, and it helps to increase the chances of success :)
