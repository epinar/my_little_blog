As a tradition, I make a new year's resolutions list every year and keep track of what I have accomplished that past year. This time, I have decided to share them here as I have my personal blogsite now. I will be keeping updates. Here is a nice photo from Munich Marienplatz during Christmas celebrations :)

Normally, I create different sections in my resolutions list, such as physical health, psychological health, career, education, musical, and so on... Here, I will share the non-private ones. 

**Education**
- Graduate from Master's degree [Q1][Pass]
- Apply to PhD positions (ideally until getting an acceptance)! [Q1][Pass]
- Learn more on reinforcement learning, distributed ML and discover niche topics [Pass]
- Write paper-reviews on the new topics you have learned [Pass]

**Language**

- Keep learning русский alphabet for the транс сибирский trip. [Q1] [Pass]

There are 20 items in the list! In the end of the year, I will see how many of them are accomplished and analyse them one by one :) Some of them might have a major role in my life path. Yet, I believe all of them are more or less equally important to keep my overall mental&psychological health and happiness in balance. Also, the grade should have some easy points as well as the harder ones, right? 

**A note on why I do that:** According to some psychological research, it is shown that putting countable goals increases the possibility of reaching to these goals (eg. using a fitbit to increase number of daily steps). Some suggest that sharing the goals publicy increase chances of success. And finally some also suggest that putting high goals is especially highly correlated with reachability.

I come from a country where the individual development is usually not seen as a positive aspect, and hard-working people are mostly recognized as asocial and weird types. In my opinion, a major reason behind that might be the corrupted government and hopeless individuals who believe that success is not based on hard-work but purely on connections. But, as I have been living in other countries for last 2.5 years, I have seen that hard working can actually be rewarded. Hence, to hard worker, I put slightly higher expectations in my 2020 resolution. Sharing this list publicly is also counted towards increasing the expectation, and it helps to increase the chances of success :)

 **Update on April 4th for first quarter**

 So far, it has been going interesting. I will add a "[Q1]" next to the items I accomplished. 
 I have been in stay-home quarantine since last month, reading a lot, playing music, doing Duolingo daily, I'm done with my Master's and will continue with doctoral studies. I have submitted a past project to a conference workshop. It was not accepted in the proceedings, but accepted only as a poster in non-proceedings track. I was kinda expecting that, and I will not work on that further as I don't have financial support for that project(also workshop attendance is expensive). But still it was nice to have some feedbacks and review other papers. 

 **Update on January 1st **

I guess it was one of the worst years to tackle such a challenging resolutions list. Until mid March, everything was going fine. Even after the Corona pandemic occured, first couple of months were okayish. As an introvert person (note: I have an extrovert mask but inside I am intro), it was magnificent for me to stay alone a lot, enjoy reading, working, playing music, writing. But it seems that quarantine effected the introverts the most. After 3-4 months, life started to become irresistable. During summer, I had a chance to see my family, but it was not enough! I missed friends, which I started to lose during quarantine. The irony was, I had many, many, many online meetings. But online meetings are not the same with being with people physically. It magnifies the virtual effect and sort of bends the reality. I imagine that many other people feel similar, and after things get back to normal, we'll have a social boom. Anyways, it has been good to see&understand that people need people. 

Coming back to the resolutions:
- I'll mark the items I accomplished with [P], and the conditionally finished ones with [CP]. For example, I could not read 24 books, but instead I read so many papers this year, and reviewed around 15 papers actively. I've written reviews for my own (or for authors), but I did not share them publicly. 
- I'll mark the failed ones with [Fail]
- I realized that some of the items were impossible, I'll mark them with [impossible]. 
- And I realized that some items were not interesting/relevant anymore (like Kaggle, not motivating anymore. publishing paper is more motivating instead.)

To sum up, it seems that starting a PhD already covers most of the items, and it comes with lots of duties, like teaching, advising students, giving talks, writing, keeping up track of the conferences etc... Besides these, I did volunteering teaching at two different places, also had voluntary advising sessions and so. So it was a really busy year for me, if not the most prolific.
Another thing is, it is not realistic to try to improve musicianship skills meanwhile. That's why I failed the theoretical music related parts in my resolutions list. Furthermore, it is not also very possible to read many books during these years, because I already read a lot and need to spend my very little free time doing other physical things, like sports/music/socializing.

These being said, I was not thinking about doing a 2021 resolutions list. But now realized that it was good for reflecting on ownself. It helps to understand owns capacity, interests, and whole year, putting a checkpoint in the history and maintaining the next steps accordingly. Hence, my rather shorter 2021 resolutions are getting posted!
