It is the ICCV time of two years period, and I wish to share some papers that caught my interest. In general, it seems that the paper submissions have increased 100% since last conference, 2017. And the number of papers accepted is around 600. Here, I point out the ones that I came across through twitter, news, my friends, and my own attention while passing through the website. 


 Exploring Randomly Wired Neural Networks for Image Recognition - https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.01569.pdf

 Learning Joint 2D-3D Representations for Depth Completion - http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~byang/papers/fusenet.pdf
