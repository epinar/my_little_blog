In this blog post, I will review the paper [Depth Prediction Without the Sensors: Leveraging Structure for Unsupervised Learning from Monocular Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.06152) published in AAAI 2019. After briefly introducing the topic and the relevant concepts, I will explain the method in my own words. Then we will discuss the results and future works. 

## Introduction

Depth prediction is a fundamental task for us to perceive the 3D environment around us. Through depth inference, we can grab the objects, move around and perform our daily tasks. To be able to create autonomous objects that can perform similar tasks to people, we should model this 3D perception. Autonomous cars should detect the other cars and pedestrians, and plan their trajectory in 3D environment. Likewise, robots need to move in their environment, grab things, carry to some distance and replace them.
