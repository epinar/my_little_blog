I"&<p>I am a masters Informatics (CS) student at the Technical University of Munich. My current interests are on computer vision, machine learning and natural language processing. I’m also an amateur cellist, playing in <a href="http://junge-muenchner-symphoniker.de">Junge Münchner Symphoniker</a>. <br />
You can find my <strong><a href="https://docs.google.com/gview?url=https://github.com/evinpinar/evinpinar.github.io/raw/master/Ornek_EvinPinar.pdf&amp;embedded=true">resume here</a></strong>.</p>

<p>On my free times, I enjoy solving algorithms problems, playing cello and having challenges:</p>

</ul>

<p>During my bachelors I was in Bogazici University Computer Engineering, beautifully located in Istanbul Turkey.</p>

<p>Being a passionate learner and a keen music listener, I will be blogging on either technical stuff, research, ideas on anything, or on music. I will be majorly posting in English, sometimes in Turkish, and perhaps one day in German (which I am learning now).</p>
