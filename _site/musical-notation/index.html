    <p>Think about a cello performance, of Yo-Yo-Ma playing Bach Suite 3, Gigue. Now think of Rostropovich. They actually play very differently which can be understood by an average classical music listener.</p>

<p>Now, check the music sheets of Bach’s pieces. There are nothing other than the black dots, which are some notes on an F key in a very simple form: no bow indications nor accents. There are no indications of how to play each of these tones.</p>

<p>Since there are no indications, the interpretation of each performer has an important role on the style of the piece. Yo-Yo-Ma bounds more tones together, whereas Rostropovich puts soft staccatos on these. We understand it either by listening their recordings, and/or by watching.</p>

<p>After a long time of musical evolution, the number of “style indicators” have increased. During the classic period, the styles of the pieces and how they should be played become more restricted. At romantic period, the number of words emerged for the emotions that should be emitted. Currently, it depends on composer’s decision, some give more freedom of interpretations or some define all possible details.</p>

<p>What are the possible details, then? Is it even possible to put everything into a form and the music sheet? At some sense, the number of words and detail increase when it is found to be necessary. There is a long process of writing, testing, writing and testing. The musical notation and theory has evolved in a similar way. Though, it is not that simple, because the aim to compose a classical piece is to let others play it. A set of possible limits are given by the composer, and all other points that are not predefined are in the hands of the performer. The performer adds her own emotions and delivers to the others. They sometimes record, but then it is a piece played by a specific person, and it should not be really compared to others. It is a new unique piece.</p>

<p>What I aim is to:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Watch the videos of different players of a single piece, say Bach’s Gigue</li>
  <li>Detect the differences in performer’s styles</li>
  <li>Find out possible extensions to the existing music notation, being it either syntactic or semantic</li>
  <li>Propose/generate a new sound according to the possible learned points. There might be two options here: 1. mix the styles of different sentences from different players. 2. Really generate a new perspective.(This might indicate that an AI can have true <strong>creativity</strong>.)</li>
</ol>

<p>This will be helpful in generating the better versions of currently played music. For instance, Rachmaninoff’s piano concerto’s are played by many, and there are recordings from the composer hisself. The players probably listen to the original recordings, and try to arise similar emotions when they play. Though, it might be helpful for them if there would be additional cues and tips along the notation.</p>
