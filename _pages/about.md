I am a CS PhD candidate at the Technical University of Munich, under Computer Aided Medical Procedures & Augmented Reality (CAMPAR) Chair, computer vision and Narvis lab. My interests are on computer vision, monocular depth prediction and 3D scene understanding. You can find my **[resume here](https://docs.google.com/gview?url=https://github.com/evinpinar/evinpinar.github.io/raw/master/Ornek_EvinPinar.pdf&embedded=true)**.

I'm also an amateur cellist, playing in [Junge Münchner Symphoniker](http://junge-muenchner-symphoniker.de). <br/>

On my free times, I enjoy solving algorithms problems, playing cello and having challenges:
- [Goodreads reading challenge 2020](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/19659783)
- [LeetCode Sunday Streak](https://leetcode.com/epinar/)
- [#100DaysOfCello](https://www.instagram.com/s/aGlnaGxpZ2h0OjE4MDE2NjM5NTk3MTA4NTEx?igshid=u5jyi05pw0ho)

During my bachelors I was in Boğaziçi University Computer Engineering, beautifully located in Istanbul Turkey. Afterwards, I have completed my Master's in CS in TUM. 

Being a passionate learner and a keen music listener, I will be blogging on either technical stuff, research, ideas on anything, or on music. I Ş be majorly posting in English, sometimes in Turkish, and perhaps one day in German (which I am learning now).
