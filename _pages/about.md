I am a masters Informatics (CS) student at the Technical University of Munich. My current interests are on computer vision, machine learning and natural language processing. 

I enjoy solving algorithms problems, playing cello and having challenges:

- [#100DaysOfCello](https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/18016639597108511/)

During my bachelors I was in Bogazici University, beautifully located in Istanbul Turkey. 

Being a passionate learner and a keen music listener, I will be blogging on either technical stuff, research, ideas on anything, or on music. I will be majorly posting in English, sometimes in Turkish, and perhaps one day in German (which I am learning now).
