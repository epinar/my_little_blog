I am a masters Informatics (CS) student at the Technical University of Munich. My current interests are on computer vision, machine learning and natural language processing. I'm also an amateur cellist, playing in [Junge MÃ¼nchner Symphoniker](http://junge-muenchner-symphoniker.de). <br/>
You can find my **[resume here](https://docs.google.com/gview?url=https://github.com/evinpinar/evinpinar.github.io/raw/master/Ornek_EvinPinar.pdf&embedded=true)**.

On my free times, I enjoy solving algorithms problems, playing cello and having challenges:
- [Goodreads reading challenge 2019](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/14816667)
- [#100DaysOfCello](https://www.instagram.com/s/aGlnaGxpZ2h0OjE4MDE2NjM5NTk3MTA4NTEx?igshid=u5jyi05pw0ho)
- [LeetCode Sunday Hard Problem](https://leetcode.com/epinar/)

During my bachelors I was in Bogazici University Computer Engineering, beautifully located in Istanbul Turkey. 

Being a passionate learner and a keen music listener, I will be blogging on either technical stuff, research, ideas on anything, or on music. I will be majorly posting in English, sometimes in Turkish, and perhaps one day in German (which I am learning now).
